\begin{description}
    \item[Acunetix] is built to specifically do heavy-duty and comprehensive scans and simulated attacks. We are not aware of any software packages capable of determining specific web application platforms or third-party packages associated with said platforms.

    \item[Security Consultants] provide services that far outclass what our tool can do, but they are very expensive to hire.

\section{Usability Testing Process}
Because the Security Crawler system lacks a robust front-end, the development team has elected to perform a usability test on Apple's iOS 5. \\\\
Four features of an iOS 5 device will be tested for ease of use:  Creating calendar events, creating reminders, responding to SMS messages, and checking weather via the dropdown menu.\\\\
The user will be presented with a pre-test questionnaire, privacy agreement, and post-test questionnaire which will be displayed following this section.

\subsection{Testing order}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The user is given a pre-test questionnaire and privay agreement
\item The user is presented the iOS device
\item The user is instructed to create a "Go to class" event at 8 AM November 11th.  This event will remind you 15 minutes it happens.
\item The user is sent a text message and instructed to respond to it
\item The user is instructed to create a reminder at 5 PM to "Do the Dishes"
\item The user is informed of how to access the dropdown menu
\item The user is instructed to get the next day's weather from the dropdown menu
\item The user is given a post-test questionnaire
\end{enumerate}

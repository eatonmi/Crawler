\section{Project Background}
\subsection{Client}
403 Software, a subsidiary of WDD Inc., analyzes and remediates insecure website design for its clients.  403 Software will also design a site from the ground up, if that service is requested; however, it should be noted that 403 Software focuses on backend almost exclusively--if it is necessary to designa  front end as well, they willc ollaborate with a design firm to ensure a quality product.

403 Software has stated that we are to be treated as an independent contractor, and, as such, they will have a fairly hands-off approach to the development of the Security Crawler system.

\subsection{Current System}

Currently, 403 Software uses a professional penetration testing suite called Acunetix to sweep and tes tpotential clients' sites.  Acunetix contains a myriad of testing tools, including a crawler similar to Security Crawler.

\subsection{Needs}

\textbf{Need: }A system that will scan a site without performing a penetration test\\
\textbf{Reason: }Penetration tests are illegal without the consent of the site's webmaster\\
\textbf{If Unfulfilled: }Whenever a test is requested, 403 Software must follow an extensive, time consuming process to verify that the person requesting the scan is in fact the webmaster.  This can unnerve and lose potential customers.\\
\textbf{Who is Affected:}403 Software, who must do the requisite check on the client requesting a scan.\\
\textbf{Benefits:}403 Software will no longer have to do the cumbersome background checks on potential clients, avoiding possibly scaring them off, and allowing them to automate the process of scanning sites for security flaws.

\textbf{Need: }An automated system for performing basics scans\\
\textbf{Reason: }Basic, non-penetration scans can be time consuming for the technician who performs them\\\textbf{If Unfulfilled:	}Much time is spent performing cursory scans that could be easily automated\\\textbf{Who is Affected:	}403 Software, employees who must do easy, rather dull work that cuold spend their time pursuing more productive projects.\\\textbf{Benefits:	}403 Software has more time to spend on non-scan projects.


\textbf{Need: }An automated way to gather information on potentialc lients and vulnerabilities that need remediation.\\
\textbf{Reason:	}As a company, 403 Software is looking to expand its client base.\\
\textbf{If Unfulfilled:	}403 Software's client base will continue to grow as it has, without the increase this system could bring.\\
\textbf{Benefits: }403 Software will be able to expand its client base with minimial increased effort.  They will also be able to build a profile for clients based around their known vulnerabilites.

\subsection{Product Overview}

Security Crawler will be a web-based, self-contained system that takes an email and a URL.  It will perform a cursory security scan on the URL, emailing the results to the provided URL.  It will also catalogue the URL's results by email, allowing 403 Software to contact potential clients for future services.

\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hosting done in Microsoft environments
    \item 403 Security will host any supporting software, such as a database
    \item Sotware will be available to the general public for use without 403 Security's explicit permission
    \item Web-based service
    \item Software will be used as a marketing tool
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item .NET Framework compatability
    \item 403 Security's ability to host services
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The web crawler cannot perform any penetration tests because of legal ramifications
    \item The system will be hosted on a Microsoft server and thuse must be Microsoft compatible
    \item 403 Security's website will be the gateway to the program and therefore the front-end must be web-based
    \item The development team is only available until May 2012.  The project is due then.
\end{itemize}

\section{Change Control}
\subsection{Receiving}
Change requests by our client will be made to us via an email describing what feature or piece of the program that he wants to be different. From this information, as a team we will look at the features, use cases, test cases, or other descriptions of the project that are affected by the requested change, and will add this in addition to the requested change.
\subsection{Handling}
Change requests will be handled through a change log in the git repository, which will track the progress on the change request. Any change will be brought up to the team via email or by direct discussion before progress is made on it. Changes to project artifacts will be judged based on neccessity. The client has the final say if no conclusion is made for any change.

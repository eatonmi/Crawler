\textbf{Sql Server: } All of the data we generate needs to be exported to a SQL Server database so that it can be accessed easily at a later date. The database will be provided by 403 Security.

\textbf{SMTP Server: } Any emails we generate will be both saved in our database and sent through 403 Security's SMTP server to reach users and Alan Wlasuk.
\\
\\
\textbf{Servers on the World Wide Web: } We will need to request information from websites to analyze them.

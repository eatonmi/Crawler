\section{Introduction}
	The Security Crawler system is a web-based system for performing non-penetration security scans of websites at the request of a potential client.  All of the non-functional requirements, design constraints, and user interfaces for the system are contained in this document.

All future usability tests will be based off of the contents of this document.  Additionally, many of the constraints in this document will heavily affect the architecutre and design of the system.  The specification of the hardware and software interfaces, in particular, will allow the crawler's output to be standardized.

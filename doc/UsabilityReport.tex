\section{Usability Report}
\subsection{Analysis}
\subsubsection{Reminder}
Most testers navigated to the Reminders app intuitively when prompted for a reminder.  One subject used the Calendar app for the reminder.  The largest problem in the Reminders task was difficulty finding the ``+'' button in the upper right hand corner of the screen regardless of iOS and technological experience.
When asked to set the time for the reminders, most users found the option to add a time to the reminder by clicking on the task.  One user added the time to the text, indicating that clicking on the text was not very obvious for setting a time.
\subsubsection{Text Message}
The purpose of the text message portion of the test was to see whether the alert banner was conspicuous enough to click on to get to the message, or if the users would swipe as in the Droid software, or go back to the home screen and get to the message from there.
All of the users used the banner alert to get to the message successfully.  One user found typing in the keyboard screen frustrating and did not successfully figure out the autocorrect feature.
\subsubsection{Weather}
The purpose of the weather test was to expose users to the pull-down menu and verify that the weather widget on the screen is easy to use.  All of the users successfully tapped the weather widget to get to the weather app and tapped the daily weather to get to the hourly weather which was hypothesized to cause problems.
\subsubsection{Calendar}
The purpose of the calendar test was to see how useful and easy to use the calendar app was.  One user went back to the reminders app to remind him about the meeting indicating that maybe the calendar app doesn't imply reminding functionality.  After using the reminders app, most users found the ``+'' button in the upper right hand corner easier than in the Reminders app.  One user did not think that that added an event, thus indicating an ambiguous meaning.

\subsection{Findings}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The ``+'' button is not intuitive but after it is found, the user is more likely to look there first for the ``adding'' functionality.
    \item The calendar app and reminders app have overlapping functionality and that confuses come users.
    \item Some functionality such as tapping the reminder to add a time to be reminded isn't apparent at first and the screens should progress into the tasks detail rather than moving on to the next task.
    \item The new banner alert system is very useful and all users found it easy to use.
    \item Non-iOS users had trouble using the autocorrect functionality.
    \item In the calendar screen, there are different buttons such as the 'add event' button or the 'import' button which look like they may have the same functionality which confused users.
    \item After a user used one feature, the rest of the features seemed to come easier as they looking in the same areas of the screen for the same functionality. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Revised Interface Design}
\begin{itemize}
    \item To make the calendar more user friendly, the reminders button could be changed by getting rid of the plus symbol and replacing it with text that says "Reminder". No extra space is needed as there is space available to the right of the "All Calendars" heading. Additionally, we would change the "import" button to say "Import" rather than the current icon it has right now. Changing both the reminder button and the import button in this manner makes all of the buttons on this screen more consistent, with all of them having text.
    \item For the reminders screen, the "plus" button could be made darker so that it stands out more. The initial design of the button blends in with the color theme, but it would be more benifical to make it easier to see since it is hard to see on the iPhone. Also, users might think that this button is disabled since the button is grey, and it is conventional for graphical user interfaces to grey a button out to signify that the button is disabled.
    \item For the weather screen, the dark rounded rectangle that contains the weather could look like it is popping out, like a button. Making the weather look like a button tells the user that the weather is able to be clicked on to get more details on weather. The same would be done to the stocks area, since that can be clicked on too. Other than this, we find that the weather screen to have good design.
    \item On the main menu, even though a user clicked on the calendar instead of the reminders to make a reminder, we find that the main menu screen to be good as it is. The icons are descriptive of what they do, and the text underneath the buttons describe exactly what screen they bring you to. To help the user that clicked on the calendar instead of reminders, the plus button could be changed to a "reminders" button, as stated above.
\end{itemize}

\section{Coding Standards}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The system will be written using C\#.NET
    \item Microsoft's ``All-In-One Code Framework,'' a style guide for VB.NET and C\#.NET programming practices will be followed. It contains information on parenthesis placement, unmanaged resource conventions, and common practices in Object Oriented Programming.  It can be found at \url{http://1code.codeplex.com/releases/view/62267#DownloadId=215635}.
    \item Since the ``All-In-One'' guidelines focus primarily on semantics, ``Design Guidelines for Developing Class Libraries'' will be used as a reference for Object Oriented Design. It can be found at \url{http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229042.aspx}.
\end{enumerate}

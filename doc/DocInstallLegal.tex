\subsection{Documentation}
We need to produce a document that describes the reports we produce in detail. The document should be clear enough that a programmer without advanced web/security knowledge could understand our report. We also need a similar document that describes all the entities in our database in detail. 
\subsection{Installation}
Our application needs to be easy to publish on an IIS 7 server with the .Net 4.0 framework installed.
\subsection{Legal}
Our application needs to extensively log all of its activities and store them to a database to verify that no legal boundaries are being crossed. As stated previously, our application cannot attempt to gain entry to files that are not publically accessible or to harm the targetted website/server in any way.
\subsection{Licensing}
Our application is fully licensed to 403 Web Security. We need to make sure that any third-party code that we use has a license allowing it to be used in for-profit, closed-source software.

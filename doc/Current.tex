\section{Current System}
Currently, 403 Security uses an expensive, complex penetration-testing tool, Acunetix, to do full penetration scans of websites at a client’s request.  This testing requires verification of ownership to be legal. The security crawler will be a free service to anyone who wishes to use it since it will not be conducting a penetration test.
403 Security charges for using this tool on a website, limiting the number of clients who will utilize 403 Security’s services.

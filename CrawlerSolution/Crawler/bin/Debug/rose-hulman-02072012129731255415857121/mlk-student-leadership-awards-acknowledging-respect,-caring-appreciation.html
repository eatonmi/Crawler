<p>These awards recognize individuals who have promoted and
advanced a mutual respect, understanding and appreciation for
diversity; made positive contributions toward improving the lives
of others; and served as a role model in the campus
community.&nbsp; The honors were presented at an annual dinner,
sponsored by Chrysler, which was part of activities this week
honoring the memory of Martin Luther King Jr. and his leadership in
the civil rights movement.</p>

<p>Michael Jessamy, director of Chrysler's occupational health
&amp; safety and medical operations, was the dinner's keynote
speaker.&nbsp; This was the sixth year for the MLK Student
Leadership Awards.</p>

<p>As president of the Engineers Without Borders (EWB) student
chapter, Angelica Patino has spent portions of the past two summers
organizing a student team converting a sugar plantation house into
a medical clinic for a Dominican Republic village.&nbsp; She
recently led a professional report-writing session from an
assessment trip to the village and the pre-design of the septic
system phase of this real-world international engineering
project.</p>

<p>"[Angelica] works really hard to make our project successful and
motivates everyone in the group to work hard, to learn new things,
and participate in all aspects of the project," an EWB member
stated in a supporting statement about Patino, a senior biomedical
engineering major.&nbsp; "Without her perseverance and energy, the
club would not be nearly as efficient, effective and successful as
it is today.&nbsp; It has been a very rewarding experience and
(Patino) continues to motivate the members to work diligently to
make the best out of every experience and to work for the
betterment of the community, much like an engineer should."</p>

<p>Kim Secrist, a senior chemistry major, is president of the
National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), a member of the
college's Student Diversity Collaborative and member of the
President's Advisory Council for Diversity.&nbsp; She chaired
NSBE's academic excellence committee, participated in technical
bowl competitions and works to recruit new members to the
organization.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Kim is focused and focuses the chapter on NSBE's mission to
increase the number of culturally responsible black engineers who
positively impact the community," stated a NSBE member about
Secrist.&nbsp; "Kim is a leader in the spirit of Martin Luther
King."</p>

<p>Passakorn Aramrueng, affectionately known as "Juice" by his
classmates, has made great efforts to include international
students in campus life and making them feel at home.&nbsp; The
senior electrical engineering student from Thailand also assisted
with the formation of the new Chinese Culture Club and is a member
of the Diversity Collaborative.</p>

<p>Faculty members honored were Mark Minster, assistant professor
of English, and Yosi Shibberu, associate professor of
mathematics.&nbsp; Minster is the past chair of the Diversity
Committee and led efforts to increase diversity awareness.&nbsp;
Shibberu serves as a role model and advisor to students, especially
those from under-represented populations.</p>

<p>Also recognized were staff members Erik Hayes, assistant dean of
student affairs, and Dexter Jordan, associate director of
admissions and multicultural recruitment.&nbsp; Hayes has increased
diversity training for members of the residence life
staff.&nbsp;&nbsp; He has helped the growing international student
population become integrated into Rose-Hulman's culture.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Jordan has helped increase the diversity population in
Rose-Hulman's student body and serves as NSBE's advisor.</p>

<p>Students earning honors in this year's MLK Jr. Week Art Contest
were Kimberly Handoko, first place; Krystina Kamjorn, second place;
Nicholas Aellen, third place; and Kevin Dorn, Kaethe Pfeiffer and
John Munson, honorable mention.&nbsp; All artworks are on display
through Friday in the lobby of the Hulman Union.&nbsp; Steve
Letsinger, coordinator of art programming, organized this year's
contest.</p>

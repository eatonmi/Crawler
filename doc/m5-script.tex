    \item During this proces we ask that you think out loud and leave the phone on the table so that we can monitor it.
    \item First, we will ask you to create a reminder. You want to be reminded at 9 pm  tonight to buy milk. 
    \item Now, we are sending you a text message.  Read the message and respond to it.
    \item Next, if you put your finger about the clock and swipe downwards, a menu will appear. Use this menu to find the weather for Terre Haute tonight at 10 pm. 
    \item Finally, we will use the calendar feature.  You want to put a meeting in the calendar this Wednesday in the Library at 1 o'clock pm. and it will last for 2 hours. I will repeat this information if you need it.

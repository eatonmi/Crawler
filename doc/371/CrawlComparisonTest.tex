	\textbf{Test Case ID} & \bf{Previous Data Present} & \textbf{Expected Result}  \\ \hline
	T0 & Yes & System receives data, and takes in data from the database, performs comparisons and generates report. The results are fed back into the database. \\ \hline
	T1 & No & System receives data, and attempts data retreival from database.  When no data is found, comparisons are skipped and a report is generated.  The results are fed back into the database \\ \hline
